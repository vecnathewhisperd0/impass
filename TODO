 * ENHANCEMENT: when dialog box redisplays for creating new password,
   it changes position (to be centered).  it should probably always
   try to hint at being centered instead of jumping around.

 * BUG: when creating a new password with the dialog box, the context field
   is still editable.  however, if i edit it, and then click "create",
   the password is created with the original contents, not the
   contents of the field at the time of clicking "create".

 * ENHANCEMENT: xdo has two input methods -- one based on XSendEvent,
   and one based on injecting keystrokes into the X session as a whole
   (the difference is whether a window ID parameter is passed to
   "type").  We use the latter right now in xsearch despite its
   possibility of leakage because some X11 applications ignore
   XSendEvent input.  Provide some hinting mechanism derived from the
   window in question to conditionally enable XSendEvent instead.

 * ENHANCEMENT: test suite!
