 * ENHANCEMENT: xdo has two input methods -- one based on XSendEvent,
   and one based on injecting keystrokes into the X session as a whole
   (the difference is whether a window ID parameter is passed to
   "type").  We use the latter right now in xsearch despite its
   possibility of leakage because some X11 applications ignore
   XSendEvent input.  Provide some hinting mechanism derived from the
   window in question to conditionally enable XSendEvent instead.

 * ENHANCEMENT: add iterator to db class?

 * ENHANCEMENT: test suite!

 * ENHANCEMENT: be able to edit a context once it is created.  for
   example, i often create a password when setting up an account on a
   remote web site.  Some account signup workflows don't tell me if
   the account name i wanted was taken until after i've signed up.  By
   then, i've created the password, and i want to adjust it manually.

 * ENHANCEMENT: can we use python clipboard bindings instead of
   "xclip -i"?

 * ENHANCEMENT: on xsearch if selected window is known browser, and
   it's possible to extract url, preseed context search with hostname
   of url.
