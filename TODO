 * BUG: xsearch context drop-down truncates long contexts.
   This is problematic if you need to distinguish between multiple
   long contexts.

 * BUG: assword add should not overwrite existing contexts

 * BUG: assword add '' should not create an entry with an empty
   context.  it should probably fail and complain, since the empty
   string is a useless context.

 * BUG: assword crashes when it gets EOF on stdin when prompting or
   when ASSWORD_PASSWORD=prompt.

 * BUG: assword should produce a more legible error message when
   ASSWORD_PASSWORD is neither "prompt" nor an int.

 * ENHANCEMENT: new subcommand "assword replace <context>"

 * ENHANCEMENT: ASSWORD_PASSWORD=stdin should just read the password
   from the first line of stdin (discarding trailing newlines).  not
   sure how this should interact with the situation where no context
   is supplied.

 * ENHANCEMENT: xdo has two input methods -- one based on XSendEvent,
   and one based on injecting keystrokes into the X session as a whole
   (the difference is whether a window ID parameter is passed to
   "type").  We use the latter right now in xsearch despite its
   possibility of leakage because some X11 applications ignore
   XSendEvent input.  Provide some hinting mechanism derived from the
   window in question to conditionally enable XSendEvent instead.

 * ENHANCEMENT: add iterator to db class?

 * ENHANCEMENT: test suite!

 * ENHANCEMENT: be able to edit a context once it is created.  for
   example, i often create a password when setting up an account on a
   remote web site.  Some account signup workflows don't tell me if
   the account name i wanted was taken until after i've signed up.  By
   then, i've created the password, and i want to adjust it manually.

 * ENHANCEMENT: can we use python clipboard bindings instead of
   "xclip -i"?

 * ENHANCEMENT: on xsearch if selected window is known browser, and
   it's possible to extract url, preseed context search with hostname
   of url.

 * ENHANCEMENT: xsearch create action should modify the database, move
   the user's focus back into the textentry (highlighting the whole
   entry text), disable the "Create" button, and *not* explicitly
   select and terminate.  The user can then select in the usual way
   (pressing enter) or can continue without selecting.

 * ENHANCEMENT: review the label texts and make sure they're saying
   reasonable things in different parts of the workflow.

 * ENHANCEMENT: ctrl+del from xsearch when a matching context is
   present should allow deletion of the indicated password.  This
   should probably prompt for confirmation.

 * ENHANCEMENT: ctrl+e from xsearch when a matching context is present
   should display another entry with the context's password in it; the
   user can then edit the password to adjust for stupid web site
   rules.  the rest of the UI should be disabled
   (set_sensitive(False)) while this password editor is active.

 * ENHANCEMENT: consider how to deal with multiple DB backends, and
   post-save and pre-open hooks (e.g. to push to and fetch from a
   remote repository of these changes)

 * ENHANCEMENT: associate default _XPASTE mechanisms with some
   contexts: if you know that certain passwords work with tools that
   prefer certain _XPASTE mechanisms, that ought to be something
   assword can figure out.  see 526990F5.6050700@guerrier.com and
   following discussion.

 * ENHANCEMENT: import scripts from common password stores
   (e.g. ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/signons.sqlite)

 * ENHANCEMENT: guess about target window to determine default _XPASTE
   mechanism (e.g. we know iceweasel works with one _XPASTE mechanism,
   but rxvt works with another one) -- we can guess by looking at the
   process that controls the window and/or the window title or other
   things (we might need to expand python-xdo to get these guesses)

 * ENHANCEMENT: use the target window title and/or pid to pre-seed the
   search box in "assword gui" (this should be pre-selected text so it
   is easy to start typing something else)
