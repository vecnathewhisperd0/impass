Assword
=======

Simple and secure password management and retrieval system.

Passwords and context strings are stored in a single OpenPGP encrypted
and signed file.  The contexts can be searched.  Passwords are
securely retrieved without displaying on the screen.  Multiple
retrieval methods are available, including inserting retrieved
password into the X clipboard, or typing them directly into an X
window.

Source
------

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone git://finestructure.net/assword
    $ cd assword

Dependencies :
  * python (>= 2.6)
  * python-gpgme - Python wrapper for the GPGME library
  * python-gtk2 - Python bindings for the GTK+ widget set

Debian
------

Debian/Ubuntu snapshot packages can be easily made from the git
source.  You can build the package from any branch but it requires an
up-to-date local branch of origin/debian, e.g.:

    $ git branch debian origin/debian

Then:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts pkg-config python-all-dev python-setuptools debhelper dpkg-dev fakeroot
    $ make debian-snapshot
    $ sudo apt-get install python-gpgme python-gtk2 python-pkg-resources python-xdo xclip
    $ sudo dpkg -i build/assword_0.*_amd64.deb
