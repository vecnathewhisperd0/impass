Assword
=======

Simple and secure password management and retrieval system.

Assword is a secure password manager that relies on your OpenPGP key
for security and is designed to integrate in a minimal fashion into
any X11 window manager.

Passwords and context strings are stored in a single OpenPGP-encrypted
and signed file (meaning entry contexts are not exposed to the
filesystem).  Along with a simple command-line interface, there is a
streamlined GUI meant for X11 window manager integration.  When
invoked, the GUI produces a prompt to search stored contexts.  New
entries can also easily be created.  Passwords are securely retrieved
without displaying on the screen.  Multiple retrieval methods are
available, including auto-typing them directly into an X11 window
(default), or inserting them into the X11 clipboard.

Source
------

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone git://finestructure.net/assword
    $ cd assword

Dependencies :
  * python (>= 2.6)
  * python-gpgme - Python wrapper for the GPGME library
  * python-gtk2 - Python bindings for the GTK+ widget set
  * python-pkg-resources - Package Discovery and Resource Access

  * python-xdo - Support for simulating X11 input (libxdo bindings)
  * xclip - Support for accessing X11 clipboard

Debian
------

Debian/Ubuntu snapshot packages can be easily made from the git
source.  You can build the package from any branch but it requires an
up-to-date local branch of origin/debian, e.g.:

    $ git branch debian origin/debian

Then:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts pkg-config python-all-dev python-setuptools debhelper dpkg-dev fakeroot
    $ make debian-snapshot
    $ sudo apt-get install python-gpgme python-gtk2 python-pkg-resources python-xdo xclip
    $ sudo dpkg -i build/assword_0.*_amd64.deb
