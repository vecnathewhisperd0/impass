Assword - simple and secure password management system
======================================================

Assword is a secure password manager that relies on your OpenPGP key
for security and is designed to integrate in a minimal fashion into
any X11 window manager.

Passwords and context strings are stored in a single OpenPGP-encrypted
and signed file (meaning entry contexts are not exposed to the
filesystem).  Along with a simple command-line interface, there is a
streamlined GUI meant for X11 window manager integration.  When
invoked, the GUI produces a prompt to search stored contexts.  New
entries can also easily be created.  Passwords are securely retrieved
without displaying on the screen.  Multiple retrieval methods are
available, including auto-typing them directly into an X11 window
(default), or inserting them into the X11 clipboard.

Then:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts pkg-config python-all-dev python-setuptools debhelper dpkg-dev fakeroot
    $ make debian-snapshot
